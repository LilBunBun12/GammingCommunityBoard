## Notes

Details I like to point out:
1. The card image grows and lights up when you hover over them and the text are overlayed the images
2. The Gaming Hub test have a moving gradient on it giving it a nice effect

The hardest parts of this project was all the start up since I'm pretty unfamiliar with react. The rest from there was just a refresher on my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills. I tried to add a loading animation but I had too much struggle with that so I decided to scrap it.
